🐍 Python Assignments Collection – Complete Guide

Welcome to the collection of Python assignments and mini-projects designed to strengthen your Python programming fundamentals and logical problem-solving skills. This repository is structured into three progressive levels — from basic Python syntax to creative and interactive projects, making it ideal for both beginners and those looking to sharpen their coding logic. 🚀💡

📘 Assignment 1: Python Fundamentals

This assignment introduces the core building blocks of Python. It is thoughtfully divided into six beginner-friendly modules that focus on concepts like syntax, variables, lists, conditionals, dictionaries, and loops.

📗 Assignment 2: Basic Python Projects

In this level, you’ll apply your fundamental knowledge through small, interactive Python projects. These cover user input, control flow, random number generation, and functions — all designed to reinforce practical logic building.

📕 Assignment 3: Intermediate Python Projects

Here, you'll level up with more creative and game-based projects like Hangman, Mad Libs, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. These projects help strengthen your understanding of strings, loops, dictionaries, random modules, and user interaction through dynamic input.
